# If You Don't Have Your Robot Yet

Breadcrumb is controlled by a Raspberry Pi 3 or 4.
If you have one of these (especially if you have a camera for it), there are numerous things you can profitably do by running the Ubiquity software on your Pi. It is as though you were running a robot with no motors.

* You can install our virtual machine on your workstation. It can be [downloaded](https://downloads.ubiquityrobotics.com/) from the Ubiquity Robotics site. It has ROS already installed.

--or, if you have a machine running Ubuntu 16.04 --
* You can set up ROS on your workstation.
The ROS site gives full instructions.

* You can connect the Pi to your workstation directly.
See the [instructions](https://ubiquityrobotics.github.io/learn/connecting).

* You can generate and print fiducials. You can then recognize fiducials using the camera.
See the [instructions](generators/how_to_generate_markers.md).

* You can follow the Pi using Rviz and rqt_image_view on your workstation.
See the [instructions](../doing_more/rviz) in the Doing More section.

* We are also offering a Gazebo simulation you can run on your Workstation and a couple of demos you can refere to, to get a sense how the Breadcrumb is intended to be running. For more infomations go [here](../doing_more/gazebo)
