# ConveyorBot: Ubiquity Robotics' Conveyor Robot


> ![ConveyorBot](breadcrumb/assets/Breadcrumb_main.jpg)


**ConveyorBot** is a mobile robot that can transport loads up to 60 kg\*.
It is a software suite that runs on a Ubiquity Robotics Magni that enables a robot conveyor application. 
In this application, the robot will follow a set of Breadcrumb markers called 'Fiducials' which are placed on the floor. 
The combination of Fiducials and the built-in touchscreen make it easy to control the navigation and path planning of Breadcrumb.
The robot optimizes the workflow and frees up human resources, thus increasing productivity and reducing logistics costs.
