# Breadcrumb: Ubiquity Robotics' Conveyor Robot


> ![Breadcrumb](breadcrumb/assets/Breadcrumb_main.jpg)


**Breadcrumb** is a mobile robot that can transport loads up to 60 kg\*.
It is a software suite that runs on a Ubiquity Robotics Magni that enables a robot conveyor application. 
In this application the robot will follow a set of Breadcrumb markers called Fiducials placed on the floor. 
The combination of Fiducials and the a built-in touchscreen make it very easy to control the navigation and path planning of Breadcrumb.
The robot optimizes the workflow and frees up human resources, thus increasing productivity and reducing logistics costs.


## Where to use Breadcrumb

The Breadcrumb is designed to automate human carryable material transportation and logistics.
It can carry the packages that can be handled by regular conveyor belts:

- height and width < 70 cm*
- length < 140 cm*
- weight < 60 kg*
- mostly human carryable
- small parts: things like screws, bolts and small electronic items
